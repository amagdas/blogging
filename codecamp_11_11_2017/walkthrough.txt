1. Agents/Processes
- are the key ingredient in building fault tolerant and scalable apps
- are shared nothing execution contexts which are PREEMTIVELY scheduled across a set of OS threads
- intrinsically capable of running concurrently

2. Anatomy of a process(cont.)
- message box
- non shared working memory
- code path & own execution flow

3. Message box
- process may receive arbitrary messages and store them in the process's inbox
- filtered using pattern matching
- message passing ties the small programs into bigger ones

4. Non shared memory(most of the time)
- each process has it's own block of RAM
- when a process is done, the memory if freed O(1)
- you have to be aware of this and think how to keep the state in short lived processes so you can reclaim the memory fast
- you can set memory limits per process

5. Process execution
- modules are the unit of code organization
- processes ar the unit of code execution
- when the code stops or errors, the process exits
