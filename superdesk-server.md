## Superdesk server overview

The Superdesk open source project hosted on [Github](https://github.com/superdesk/superdesk) is conceptually
built following the REST architecture, the client is an Angular driven app and the backend being built using Python and
the Flask based [Eve framework](http://python-eve.org)

This post will do a deep dive on the backend side of the solution, the client side will be tackled by an upcoming post.
